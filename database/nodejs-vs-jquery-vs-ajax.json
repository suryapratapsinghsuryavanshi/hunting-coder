    "content": "<p>In this article, we will discuss the difference between NodeJs, AJAX, and JQuery.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let us discuss JavaScript, JavaScript is one of the fastest-growing programming languages in the technology sector. Because it is a very flexible programming language with some very useful advantages like hosting, dynamic prototyping, and more. All this has been possible due to some of its important frameworks and libraries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out this article if you want to learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/javascript-tutorial\/\">JavaScript<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/media.geeksforgeeks.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/20210718033408\/nodeajaxjquery-660x283.png\" style=\"width:660px\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>NodeJs:<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>NodeJs is a runtime environment for JavaScript, working on the v8 engine, which is very powerful, so nodeJs takes advantage of this to allow JavaScript to be run as a server-side language with the help of nodeJs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to learn more about NodeJs refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/nodejs-tutorials\/\">this article<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>AJAX:<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>AJAX stands for asynchronous javascript and XML the user to make a request to the server for the data without any reloading and without block, any other request also so provide a smooth performance to fetch the data to the server and show to the page.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to learn more about AJAX refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/ajax-introduction\/\">this article.<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>JQuery:<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This javascript library makes everything easy and provides a very effective method for doing something in the front end and gives many essential features like browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to learn more about JQuery refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/jquery-tutorials\/\">this article.<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Difference between Nodejs, AJAX, and jQuery:<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th><strong>NodeJs<\/strong><\/th>\r\n\t\t\t<th><strong>AJAX<\/strong><\/th>\r\n\t\t\t<th><strong>JQuery<\/strong><\/th>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>NodeJs is an open-source framework based on JavaScript v8 engine.&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>AJAX is a web development technique for making asynchronous calls to the server.<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>jQuery is a JavaScript library for designing and make some web development tasks easy.<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>It makes it possible to run javascript outside of the browser.<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>It works on the browser or outside of the browser also.<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>It makes it easy to use AJAX in your project.<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>It works with one non-blocking i\/o modal.<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>It works with one non-blocking asynchronous request.<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Block other events if the current event is running.<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>It only works with JavaScript.
